## What

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker

## Why

Most online poker tools are cool, but

- Registration needed. Not friendly.
- Not vivid. No fun.
- Connection sucks. Especially from China.

## Donate

Poker4Fun is a side project we built in our spare time. This app has become popular thanks to the hard working of our [contributors](https://github.com/IFS49F/poker/graphs/contributors) and valuable feedbacks from our users. As an open source software, Poker4Fun is and will always be free for everyone, but it [costs money](#cost) to run the server and renew the domain. We need your help to keep Poker4Fun free and sustainable, and would be much appreciated if you could buy us a cup of coffee ☕️  to fuel our coding frenzy 🔥.
